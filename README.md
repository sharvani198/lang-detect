## Language Detection

[European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/) is a text dataset used for evaluating language detection engines. The 1.5GB corpus includes 21 languages spoken in EU.
This repo trains a RNN model on this dataset and tries to classify the data in the europarl.test file.

The data set will need to be downloaded and extracted before running the jupyter notebook. The entire corpus should be in a txt directory in the repo location.
